# RIVDW — Build-Time Metadata Ingestion System

Reads database structure from SQL Server and Oracle, generates plain-English descriptions using an LLM, and stores the enriched metadata in a vector database for natural-language querying.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in your Groq API key and database connection details

# 3. Run the app
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

## What This System Does

RIVDW is a tool that teaches a computer what your databases mean — so that later, people can ask questions in plain English like "show me all compliance violations this quarter" and the system knows which tables and columns to look at.

The build-time pipeline does the preparation work:

1. It connects to your databases and reads the list of every table and column (not the actual data — just the structure).
2. It sends each table to an AI model (Groq) and asks it to write a plain-English description: what the table stores, which business process uses it, and what a business analyst would call it.
3. A "guardian" checks every description for quality — rejects thin descriptions, flags missing domain tags, catches filler phrases.
4. The approved descriptions are saved into a vector database (Qdrant) so the system can later find the right table even if the user uses a slightly different word.
5. Every version of every description is saved to a SQLite archive so you can see the full history of changes.

You can review and correct AI descriptions through the **Build Metadata** screen, and all your edits are preserved in the history log.

## Connecting Your Local SQL Server

Add the display name, type, and schema to `config/databases.json` (this file is safe to commit):

```json
{
  "name": "compliance_db",
  "display_name": "Compliance Database",
  "db_type": "sqlserver",
  "schema": "dbo",
  "domain_tag": "compliance",
  "owner": "your-name@company.com",
  "description": "Describe what this database contains."
}
```

Then add one line to your `.env` file with the connection string (this file stays secret):

```
compliance_db=mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect=DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;DATABASE=ComplianceDB;Trusted_Connection=yes;
```

`Trusted_Connection=yes` means the app uses your Windows login — no username or password needed.

You must have the **ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server** installed. Download it from Microsoft's website if it is not already on your machine.

## Screens

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Build Metadata** | Select one database → generate AI descriptions → edit inline → view full change history |
| **Run Pipeline** | Batch-process all databases at once, watch step-by-step progress, download results |
| **Review Metadata** | Cross-database view — filter, approve, reject, or bulk-edit descriptions |
| **Manage Glossary** | Map business terms to database columns |

## LLM Configuration

- **Primary**: Groq API (`GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env`)
- **Fallback**: VS Code LM API — requires the `vscode-lm-sample` extension running in VS Code. Set `GROQ_ENABLED=false` to force fallback.

## Adding a New Database

There are two steps — one file for metadata (safe to commit), one line in `.env` for the secret connection string.

**Step 1 — add an entry to `config/databases.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "my_db",
  "display_name": "My Database",
  "db_type": "sqlserver",
  "schema": "dbo",
  "domain_tag": "compliance",
  "owner": "team@example.com",
  "description": "Short description of what this database contains."
}
```

The `name` field is the key — it must match exactly what you put in `.env`.

**Step 2 — add one line to `.env`:**

```
my_db=mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect=DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=server.example.com,1433;DATABASE=MyDatabase;UID=readonly_user;PWD=secret;
```

For Oracle:

```
my_oracle_db=oracle+oracledb://readonly_user:secret@host:1521/?service_name=SERVICENAME
```

Restart the app after editing either file.

## File Guide — What Each File Does

| File | What it does in plain language |
|------|-------------------------------|
| `.env` | Your secret config — database passwords, Groq API key. Never commit this file. |
| `.env.example` | A safe template showing what goes in `.env`. Commit this one. |
| `config/databases.json` | List of databases and their metadata — display name, type, schema, domain tag, owner, description. Safe to commit. Add a new entry here to register a database. |
| `config/settings.py` | Reads `.env` and makes all settings available to the rest of the code. Looks up connection strings by matching each `databases.json` name to a `.env` key. |
| `config/strings.py` | Every word that appears in the UI or in an AI prompt lives here. Change a label or prompt in one place and it updates everywhere. |
| `database/connection_registry.py` | Reads the database list from settings and creates a live connection for each one. |
| `database/schema_crawler.py` | Connects to each database and reads the list of tables and columns from the system catalog — never reads actual data. |
| `database/sqlite_store.py` | Manages the local SQLite file: stores run history, every version of every metadata entry (the change log), and app-level settings. |
| `models/metadata_entry.py` | The data shape for one table or column description — what fields it has, what values are allowed. |
| `models/pipeline_state.py` | The data shape for what flows between pipeline steps — carries raw entries, enriched entries, counts, errors. |
| `pipeline/graph.py` | Wires all pipeline steps together using LangGraph. Also logs each run to SQLite. |
| `pipeline/single_db_pipeline.py` | Processes one database at a time, table by table. Used by the Build Metadata screen. Makes one LLM call per table (covers all columns at once). |
| `pipeline/nodes/connect_node.py` | Tests database connections before the crawl starts. Skips unreachable databases. |
| `pipeline/nodes/crawl_node.py` | Reads table and column structure from the database catalog and saves a snapshot file. |
| `pipeline/nodes/diff_node.py` | Compares the new crawl against the previous snapshot and passes only changed or new entries forward — saves LLM cost on unchanged tables. |
| `pipeline/nodes/normalise_node.py` | Converts database-specific type names (like Oracle `NUMBER` or SQL Server `datetime`) into a consistent vocabulary. |
| `pipeline/nodes/enrich_node.py` | Calls the LLM (Groq or VS Code LM) to write plain-English descriptions for each entry. Processes in batches. |
| `pipeline/nodes/guardian_node.py` | Checks every AI description for quality: Is it long enough? Does it avoid filler phrases? Is the domain tag set? Marks entries as approved, needs review, or rejected. |
| `vector_store/qdrant_store.py` | Saves, updates, and searches descriptions in the local Qdrant vector database. The vector store always holds the latest approved version. |
| `glossary/domain_glossary.py` | Loads the business-term-to-column mapping from `glossary_data/glossary.json` and provides lookup methods used during enrichment. |
| `glossary_data/glossary.json` | The actual glossary entries — editable by business users directly or through the Manage Glossary screen. |
| `snapshots/` | JSON files — one per pipeline run — storing the raw crawl output. Used to detect what changed since the last run. |
| `ui/app.py` | The Streamlit entry point. Only handles page routing — no business logic here. |
| `ui/pages/build_metadata.py` | **Main working screen.** Select a database, generate AI descriptions, see them table by table, edit any description, save, and view the full change history at the bottom. |
| `ui/pages/run_pipeline.py` | Batch pipeline screen — runs all databases at once, shows step-by-step progress, downloads a summary CSV. |
| `ui/pages/review_metadata.py` | Cross-database review screen — filter by database, domain, or status, approve or reject entries in bulk. |
| `ui/pages/manage_glossary.py` | Add, edit, and delete business-term-to-column mappings. Changes save immediately to `glossary.json`. |
